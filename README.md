Projects Overview -

1. PyQt1_0.py (User Registration System): 
- A robust registration module featuring Brazilian data standards. It includes real-time validation for CPF and RG, along with full integration with the Brazilian postal service for address auto-completion.


2. PyQt2_0.py (ViaCEP Address Finder): 
- A streamlined address lookup tool powered by the ViaCEP API. Users can retrieve complete location details instantly by entering a Brazilian postal code (CEP).


3. PyQt3_0.py (Crypto Currency Tracker): 
- A financial dashboard integrated with the CoinGecko API. It fetches real-time cryptocurrency prices and provides automatic conversion to both Brazilian Real (BRL) and US Dollar (USD).


4. PyQt4_0.py (NASA APOD Explorer & AI Analyst): An advanced astronomical tool that fetches NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day. It features:
- Gemini 2.0 Flash AI: Generates automated scientific reports of space images.
- Multilingual Support: Auto-translates NASA's data into Portuguese.
- Media Handling: Supports high-res image saving and embedded video playback.


5. PyQt5_0.py NASA Explorer (AI-Powered Space Reporter):
- An advanced astronomical dashboard that transforms NASA’s raw data into an immersive multimedia experience. Key features include:
Multimodal AI Pipeline: Integrates Groq (Llama 3.1) for deep scientific reporting and Kling AI (via Fal.ai) to animate static space images into 5-second cinematic videos.
- Smart Content Layering: Features a three-tier information display: original NASA technical data, automated Portuguese translation, and AI-generated historical analysis.
- Interactive Voice & Media: Built-in Edge-TTS narration for accessibility and a customized PyQt5 video player for real-time viewing of AI-generated cosmic motion.
- Time-Travel Navigation: Full calendar synchronization allowing users to explore decades of NASA's APOD archives with automated UI state management.


6. 6.py — NASA Explorer v2.0 (Search, AI & Media Lab):
- A comprehensive desktop application that unifies NASA image discovery, AI-powered scientific analysis, and multimedia generation into a single PyQt5 interface.
Hybrid NASA Access: Integrates APOD (date-based astronomy content) with a keyword-driven search engine for the NASA Image Library, supporting instant previews via QComboBox.
- AI Analysis Pipeline: Uses Llama 3.1 (via Groq API) to generate detailed scientific reports in PT-BR, alongside automatic translation of titles and descriptions.
- Enhanced Media Processing: Applies autocontrast and sharpness filters to images (Pillow) and can generate short AI-animated space videos using AnimateDiff + Stable Diffusion.
- Multilingual Voice Narration: Three-tab system (English, Portuguese, AI Analysis) with independent Edge-TTS speech synthesis and real-time audio playback.
- Robust UX & Local Control: Threaded tasks, error handling, file export (images/video), GPU/CPU auto-detection, and an intuitive layout designed for smooth astronomical exploration.
