- A financial dashboard integrated with the CoinGecko API. It fetches real-time cryptocurrency prices and provides automatic conversion to both Brazilian Real (BRL) and US Dollar (USD).

4. PyQt4_0.py (NASA APOD Explorer & AI Analyst): An advanced astronomical tool that fetches NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day. It features:

- Gemini 2.0 Flash AI: Generates automated scientific reports of space images.
- Multilingual Support: Auto-translates NASA's data into Portuguese.
- Media Handling: Supports high-res image saving and embedded video playback.

5. PyQt5_0.py Explorer 2026 (AI-Powered Space Reporter):
- An advanced astronomical dashboard that transforms NASA’s raw data into an immersive multimedia experience. Key features include:
Multimodal AI Pipeline: Integrates Groq (Llama 3.1) for deep scientific reporting and Kling AI (via Fal.ai) to animate static space images into 5-second cinematic videos.
- Smart Content Layering: Features a three-tier information display: original NASA technical data, automated Portuguese translation, and AI-generated historical analysis.
- Interactive Voice & Media: Built-in Edge-TTS narration for accessibility and a customized PyQt5 video player for real-time viewing of AI-generated cosmic motion.
